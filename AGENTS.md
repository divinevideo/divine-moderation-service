# Repository Guidelines

## Divine Context And Brain

Before broad product, architecture, protocol, cross-repo, service-boundary, or pull-request authoring, review, or modification work, read the shared Divine context primer.

Resolve the context directory and clone it there if it is missing:

```bash
CONTEXT_DIR="${DIVINE_CONTEXT_ROOT:-../divine-context}"
[ -e "$CONTEXT_DIR/.git" ] || gh repo clone divinevideo/divine-context "$CONTEXT_DIR"
```

Use that value as `<context-dir>` below.

The `divine-context` repo is private, so cloning requires GitHub access. If clone, network, or auth fails, continue from the local repo docs and avoid cross-repo assumptions.

Before updating an existing context checkout, verify it is clean and on its default branch. If it is clean and on the default branch, update it with `git -C <context-dir> pull --ff-only`. If it is dirty, on another branch, cannot fast-forward, or network/auth fails, leave it untouched and say the context may be stale.

Read `<context-dir>/AGENT_CONTEXT.md` and follow its instructions. If unavailable, continue from the local repo docs and avoid cross-repo assumptions.

Before working on a pull request, follow `<context-dir>/PR_REVIEW.md` and use `<context-dir>/PR_REVIEW_TEAMS.md` to request the normal team and check takeover authority. Ordinary review remains open to any eligible Divine human. Before modifying a pull-request branch, enforce the mapping and every takeover gate; if the mapping cannot be read, feedback-only review may continue but automated takeover must stop. Request and verify required human review automatically when tooling permits. If the runbook is unavailable, leave the pull request open and report the blocker.

If a Divine Brain search or ask tool is available, you may use it for company memory. Treat it as optional and credentialed: tool names vary by client, and work must continue when Brain is unavailable. When Brain results influence work, cite the returned document ids. Never commit Brain credentials or expose Brain-derived sensitive content in public PRs, issues, branch names, commit messages, code comments, logs, screenshots, release notes, or externally shared agent transcripts.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Worker code lives under `src/`.
- Data and runtime configuration lives in `wrangler.toml`, `migrations/`, and supporting scripts under `scripts/`.
- Operational and product docs live in `README.md`, `CONTENT_MODERATION.md`, `CDN_INTEGRATION.md`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_SETUP.md`, `ADMIN_SETUP.md`, and `docs/`.
- Keep queue processing, moderation policy, admin endpoints, and relay integration changes scoped so they are easy to review.

## Build, Test, and Validation Commands
- `npm run lint`: custom repo lint pass.
- `npm test`: Vitest suite.
- `npm run dev`: local Worker development with Wrangler.
- `npm run deploy`: deploy the Worker. Use only when intentionally shipping changes.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow the existing TypeScript, Cloudflare Worker, and queue-processing patterns already established in the repo.
- Keep moderation policy changes, queue behavior changes, and admin/auth changes focused. Do not mix unrelated cleanup or refactors into the same PR.
- Verify URLs, relay endpoints, secrets, and bindings against `wrangler.toml` and the relevant docs before changing them. Do not hardcode environment-specific domains or secrets in application code.

## Security & Operational Notes
- Never commit secrets, API tokens, private keys, Cloudflare Access credentials, or screenshots/logs containing sensitive values.
- Public issues, PRs, branch names, screenshots, and descriptions must not mention corporate partners, customers, brands, campaign names, or other sensitive external identities unless a maintainer explicitly approves it. Use generic descriptors instead.
- Be explicit about any changes that affect moderation outcomes, quarantine decisions, admin auth, or relay publishing behavior.

## Pull Request Guardrails
- PR titles must use Conventional Commit format: `type(scope): summary` or `type: summary`.
- Set the correct PR title when opening the PR. Do not rely on fixing it later.
- If a PR title is edited after opening, verify that the semantic PR title check reruns successfully.
- Keep PRs tightly scoped. Do not include unrelated formatting churn, dependency noise, or drive-by refactors.
- Temporary or transitional code must include `TODO(#issue):` with a tracking issue.
- UI, admin, or externally visible API behavior changes should include screenshots, sample payloads, or an explicit note that there is no visual change.
- PR descriptions must include a summary, motivation, linked issue, and manual validation plan.
- Before requesting review, run the relevant checks for the files you changed, or note what you could not run.
